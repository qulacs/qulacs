Qulacs is a python/C++ library for fast simulation of large, noisy, or parametric quantum circuits.

Qulacs is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/qulacs/qulacs/blob/master/LICENSE).

**Note**
Qulacs-Osaka/qulacs-osaka will be integrated into the qulacs/qulacs. For more details, please refer to [Information](#Information) section.

## Quick Install

```
pip install qulacs
```

Notice: this command install the Qulacs binary which requires AVX2 features.
If your computer doesn't support AVX2, the Python program using Qulacs installed by this command will almost certainly fail due to segmentation fault or something else.
You should check your CPU and if it doesn't support AVX2 (i.e. older than Haswell) then you have to install Qulacs from the source code.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/qulacs/qulacs.git
```

If you have NVIDIA GPU with CUDA installed try:
```
pip install qulacs-gpu
```

## Feature
- Fast quantum circuit simulation with parallelized C/C++ backend
- Noisy quantum gate for simulation of NISQ devices
- Parametric quantum gates for variational methods
- Circuit compression for fast simulation
- GPU support for fast simulation
- Many utility functions for research

### Test environment:
- Azure NC6s_v3 (6vcpu / Mem112GiB)
  - Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2690 v4 @ 2.60GHz
  - Tesla V100 PCIE (driver 440.33.01)

### What is Benchmarked
   for each qubit number N:
   - Apply simultaneous random single-qubit Pauli-X rotation  
   
   and then repeat:
   - Apply CNOT(i,(i+1)%N) for all i in [0..N-1]
   - Apply simultaneous random single-qubit Pauli-X rotation  
   
   for N times.
   
#### Note
 - execution time include time for creating quantum circuit
 - benchmark was done with float64 precision (qsim was done with float32)

This benchmark was done with majour quantum circuit simulators with python interface.  
[Yao](https://github.com/QuantumBFS/Yao.jl) is quantum circuit simulator using Julia that is as fast as Qulacs.  
Benchmark inculde Yao can be found [here](https://github.com/Roger-luo/quantum-benchmarks/blob/master/RESULTS.md).  


## Requirement

- C++ compiler (gcc or VisualStudio)
    - gcc/g++ >= 7.0.0 (checked in Linux, MacOS, cygwin, MinGW, and WSL)
    - Microsoft VisualStudio C++ 2015 or later
- python 2.7 or 3.x
- cmake >= 3.0
- git
- (option) CUDA >= 8.0
- (option) AVX2 support

If your system supports AVX2 instructions, SIMD optimization is automatically enabled. 
If you want to enable GPU simulator, install qulacs through <code>qulacs-gpu</code> package or build from source.
Note that <code>qulacs-gpu</code> includes CPU simulator. You don't need to install both.

Qulacs is tested on the following systems.

- Ubuntu 16.04 / 18.04
- MacOS X Sierra
- Windows 10


## Install from Source
If you encounter some troubles, see [troubleshooting](http://qulacs.org/md_4__trouble_shooting.html).


### Install python libs from source

Install (Multi-thread without GPU)
```
python setup.py install
```

Install (Multithread with GPU. CUDA is required)
```
python setup_gpu.py install
```

Install (Single-thread without GPU. For launching multiple qulacs processes.)
```
python setup_singlethread.py install
```

Uninstall
```
pip uninstall qulacs
```

### Build C++ and python library

#### GCC
```
git clone https://github.com/qulacs/qulacs.git
cd qulacs
./script/build_gcc.sh
```

When you want to build with GPU, use <code>build_gcc_with_gpu.sh</code>.

#### MSVC
```
git clone https://github.com/qulacs/qulacs.git
cd qulacs
script/build_msvc_2017.bat
```

When you want to build with GPU, use <code>build_msvc_2017_with_gpu.bat</code>. If you use MSVC2015, replace "2017" in file names to "2015".

## Sample code
### Python
```python
from qulacs import Observable, QuantumCircuit, QuantumState
from qulacs.gate import Y,CNOT,merge

state = QuantumState(3)
state.set_Haar_random_state()

circuit = QuantumCircuit(3)
circuit.add_X_gate(0)
merged_gate = merge(CNOT(0,1),Y(1))
circuit.add_gate(merged_gate)
circuit.add_RX_gate(1,0.5)
circuit.update_quantum_state(state)

observable = Observable(3)
observable.add_operator(2.0, "X 2 Y 1 Z 0")
observable.add_operator(-3.0, "Z 2")
value = observable.get_expectation_value(state)
print(value)
```

If you want to run it on GPU, install GPU-enabled qulacs and replace <code>QuantumState</code> in the above codes to <code>QuantumStateGpu</code>.

### C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cppsim/state.hpp>
#include <cppsim/circuit.hpp>
#include <cppsim/observable.hpp>
#include <cppsim/gate_factory.hpp>
#include <cppsim/gate_merge.hpp>

int main(){
    QuantumState state(3);
    state.set_Haar_random_state();

    QuantumCircuit circuit(3);
    circuit.add_X_gate(0);
    auto merged_gate = gate::merge(gate::CNOT(0,1),gate::Y(1));
    circuit.add_gate(merged_gate);
    circuit.add_RX_gate(1,0.5);
    circuit.update_quantum_state(&state);

    Observable observable(3);
    observable.add_operator(2.0, "X 2 Y 1 Z 0");
    observable.add_operator(-3.0, "Z 2");
    auto value = observable.get_expectation_value(&state);
    std::cout << value << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Build command for g++:
```sh
g++ -O2 -I ./<qulacs_path>/include -L ./<qulacs_path>/lib <your_code>.cpp -fopenmp -lcsim_static -lcppsim_static
```

If you want to run it on GPU, include <code>cppsim/state_gpu.hpp</code> and replace <code>QuantumState</code> with <code>QuantumStateGpu</code>.

## Information

Experimental new features of Qulacs that have been developed in the Osaka University repository [Qulacs-Osaka/qulacs-osaka](https://github.com/Qulacs-Osaka/qulacs-osaka) will be integrated into the original [Qulacs](https://github.com/qulacs/qulacs). The following new features will be added!!!

### Integration date
Scheduled around August 2022.

### New features
The main new features are as follows
- Providing type hint files for Python
	- Configure tools such as mypy to take full advantage of type hint information.
	- mypy can detect the use of incorrect argument types in the qulacs API.
- Sending exceptions with detailed information
	- Makes it easier to understand the cause of the error.
	- (For Jupyter Notebook users) kernel is less likely to crash if incorrect input is given.
- Added backprop (gradient calculation by error back propagation method) to ParametricQuantumCircuit
	- It is faster than calculating gradients one by one.
- Gradient Calculator

### Scope of impact
The existing functionality has not been changed, so the existing code using Qulacs will continue to work as is. However, since the implementation language of csim has been changed from C to C++, changes may be necessary if you have been using direct calls to csim.
Due to the C++ change, all complex numbers are now handled by `std::complex`.

### Add dependency libraries
This integration adds boost as a dependency library.
There will be some changes in the installation procedure.
