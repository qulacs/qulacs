    "Quantum gates are divided into two types: special gates and general gates. In Qulacs, quantum gates are not limited to unitary operators, and the operation of updating an arbitrary quantum state, such as Instrument and CPTP-map, is also called a gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special gates are those that have a pre-specified gate matrix and can only perform limited deformations on quantum gates. For example, Pauli gate, rotation Pauli gate, projection measurement, etc. are supported. The advantage of a special gate is that the update function of the quantum state is more efficient than a general gate with limited properties. Also, at the time of definition, it holds information on whether or not it is diagonalized by each qubit at the basis of some Pauli, and this information is used for circuit optimization. The disadvantage of special gates is that the possible operations on the gates are limited for the reasons mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "A gate that has an explicit operation gate matrix is called a general gate. The advantage of general gates is that you can specify the gate matrix as you like, but the disadvantage is that the updates are slower than special gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common operations for quantum gates\n",
    "The gate matrix of the generated quantum gate can be obtained with the `get_matrix` function. Control qubits are not included in the gate matrix. In particular, be careful when obtain gates that do not have a gate matrix (for example, n-qubit Pauli rotating gates), which require a very large amount of memory and time. `print` function displays the gate information."
